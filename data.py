        Hi my name is Cassey! I am a new grad computer engineering student
        from University of Toronto! I am interested in building good software! 
        I have experience with building software from school, internships, and hackathons! 
        Outside of this, I love being active! I like hiking, going on long walks in downtown, and playing sports!
